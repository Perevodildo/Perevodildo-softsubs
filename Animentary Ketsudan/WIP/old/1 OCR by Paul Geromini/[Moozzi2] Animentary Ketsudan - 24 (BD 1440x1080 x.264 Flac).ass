Dialogue: 0,0:13:11.14,0:13:17.89,Default,,0,0,0,,Right? Even so, since we are going to fight a naval battle, should the air force be responsible for only a light jab?

Dialogue: 0,0:13:20.41,0:13:25.07,Default,,0,0,0,,> The honor of defeating Yamato, the embodiment of the Japanese Navy, is naturally decided to be
Dialogue: 0,0:13:25.07,0:13:29.79,Default,,0,0,0,,the aircraft carrier unit, which is representative of the US Navy, and our 58 MTF. Is there any other way?
