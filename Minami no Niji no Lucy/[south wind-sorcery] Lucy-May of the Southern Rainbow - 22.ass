Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.71,0:05:20.25,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,How can you say that after we've seen a dingo\Npouncing on both the sheep and the rabbit?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.25,0:05:22.61,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,But it doesn't try to pounce on humans, does it?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.61,0:05:24.40,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,My, you forgot already?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.40,0:05:26.40,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,On the way from the seashore to Adelaide...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.40,0:05:30.55,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,It was just following after us,\Nand eventually, it never attempted to attack us.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.55,0:05:33.61,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,It's true that dingos\Ndon't seem very interested in humans.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.62,0:05:36.71,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,So I figured, if you raise a dingo\Nfrom very little age,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.72,0:05:40.26,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,maybe it can make just as good a friend\Nfor humans as the usual dogs do?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.27,0:05:44.56,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,It appears that among the aborigines\Nthere are some who succeeded in taming a dingo.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.57,0:05:47.46,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe that's also thanks\Nto adopting it from the little age.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.46,0:05:49.57,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,So adopting a dingo is the way to go!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.57,0:05:52.06,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,Hold it, hold it! You'd best drop it right away.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.07,0:05:57.29,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,That kind of a wild beast might stay tame most\Nof the time, but then fly into a rage all of a sudden!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.29,0:05:58.92,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,And then, you couldn't keep it at bay.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.92,0:06:01.29,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,Still... One day, I'll do it!
