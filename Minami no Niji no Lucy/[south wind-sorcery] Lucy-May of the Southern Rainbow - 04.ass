Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.86,0:05:11.48,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,Eh? I wonder what his vision for Adelaide is. 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.33,0:05:17.22,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,Ben, don't set your hopes too high.\NThey've just barely started building it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.22,0:05:20.44,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,It's still nothing more than a few scattered houses\Namong forests and fields.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.44,0:05:22.43,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,There's not many people living in it?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.43,0:05:25.05,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,Yes. The city's populace is mere 300 residents.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.68,0:05:31.16,Lucy-Default,,0,0,0,,However, the immigrants will keep following\Nin our footsteps at an ever-increasing rate.
