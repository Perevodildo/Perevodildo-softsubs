1
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,540
First Friend

2
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,470
Good evening, everyone.

3
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,281
I am Ernest Thompson Seton, the

4
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:33,580
author of the Animal Chronicles.

5
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,660
Starting tonight, I will tell you a
story about Jackie the Bear.

6
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,500
Around 100 years ago, barely 100 years after

7
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:47,980
the independence of the
United States of America.

8
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:52,942
Right in the middle of the Sierra
Nevada Mountains, which rise

9
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:56,478
to the east of California on
the border with Nevada.

10
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,758
A boy lived near a beautiful lake called Lake Taho.

11
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,715
This story is about the wonderful friendship between the

12
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,590
boy and a bear cub living in the nearby Tallac Mountains.

13
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:45,614
Of all the cedars in the world, the American variant grows the biggest.

14
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:50,722
Among them, under the tallest
cedar tree on Mount Tallac,

15
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:58,220
lived a large grizzly bear
nicknamed Pinto.

16
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:13,572
During her long winter hibernation, Pinto had twin cubs.

17
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:18,060
They were siblings, an older brother bear and a younger sister bear.

18
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:30,544
Come on, it's okay.

19
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,558
Come on out, kids.

20
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:42,977
It's too bright!

21
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,330
What's wrong? It's all right.

22
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:47,737
Hurry up and come out.

23
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,244
This place is so bright...

24
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:06,081
Yeah...

25
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,948
Come on, kids. From now on, you're free to play here all you like.

26
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,509
Be careful.

27
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:19,695
Can we really play in such a big place?

28
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,453
Oh, it's cold!

29
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:24,421
What's this stuff?

30
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:27,102
It dosen't smell like anything.

31
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:33,870
Son, this is snow, you know.

32
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,740
Wow, this is snow?

33
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:40,086
It's snow! It's snow!

34
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:44,805
Brother, it's cold!

35
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,205
Wait!

36
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:56,797
Stay away from me, brother!

37
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,477
Help!

38
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:01,861
?

39
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:06,129
Son!

40
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,311
Come on, you just came out.
You have to be more careful.

41
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,509
Wow! That was a shock...

42
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,220
Huh?

43
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,440
Oh, Mother!

44
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:30,343
What's that shiny thing?

45
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,214
That thing? It's called a lake.

46
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,574
It's pretty...

47
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,519
Hey, Mother, let's go to it!

48
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,095
Calm down, son.

49
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,152
This is your first time outside.

50
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,213
Besides, there are humans around there, so you have to be careful.

51
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Humans?

52
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,063
What's a human?

53
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,795
Humans walk around on two legs,
and are very scary enemies to us.

54
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,900
They're scary?

55
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,345
Hey, why are they scary?

56
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,460
I can't tell you right now.

57
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,927
Come on, let's go find
something to eat instead.

58
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,216
Your mom's already really hungry.

59
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,260
Yes, Pinto was hungry and dazed.

60
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,960
And it was no wonder.

61
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:17,810
Before going into her long winter sleep,
she had to eat as much as she could.

62
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:22,330
Five months later,
she hadn't eaten a thing,

63
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:28,951
and had been feeding her cubs
milk the entire time.

64
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:01,910
Can we really eat this stuff?

65
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:03,821
I wanna try it too.

66
00:07:04,078 --> 00:07:05,505
Right, I'll get it out.

67
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:16,629
?

68
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:20,834
Hey!

69
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,084
Hey, wait!

70
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:31,280
Stop it!

71
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,340
Wait up!

72
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:33,910
Stop it!

73
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:36,366
Cut it out!

74
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:37,841
Hey!

75
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:39,110
Stop it!

76
00:07:46,455 --> 00:07:47,515
- What's wrong?
- Look.

77
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,330
What's that?

78
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:53,895
It must be one of those
humans Mother told us about.

79
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,767
No way! It dosen't look that scary.

80
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,630
Let's go after it.

81
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,191
I don't want to. I'm scared.

82
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:05,752
I'll go alone, then!

83
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:06,780
Stop!

84
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:08,006
Brother...

85
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:17,273
Where's it going?

86
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:28,901
?

87
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,816
Wait up!

88
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,297
Where did it go?

89
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:57,779
It's in there!

90
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:13,711
That was a surprise!

91
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,126
That's where Mother said humans live.

92
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:25,306
But what kind of animal is this scary
thing that walks on two legs?

93
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,956
Right, I'm gonna check it out!

94
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,127
Ow!

95
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,007
Ah, it must be Lan.

96
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,850
He's hiding, right?

97
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,604
Okay, let's get 'em.

98
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:03,190
Gotcha!

99
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,970
Huh? He's not here...

100
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,026
Grandpa Rocky!

101
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:09,452
Ah, so that's were you've been hiding.

102
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,581
You got me again this time.

103
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:14,016
Hello, Grandpa Rocky.

104
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:17,141
Did you get any work done today?

105
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,110
Nope. I haven't found a single nugget in three weeks.

106
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,883
Huh?

107
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Really?

108
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,451
Hey, don't worry about it.

109
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,280
When you look for gold,
you can do it as much as you want.

110
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,967
This river was the start of an amazing
gold rush thirty years ago.

111
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:41,487
But those people gave up on
finding gold and left a long time ago.

112
00:10:42,077 --> 00:10:46,083
Grandpa Rocky's the only one
still going at it, right?

113
00:10:46,183 --> 00:10:46,930
Huh?

114
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:53,111
Oh, they were just a bunch of
bad people with no patience.

115
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:57,574
These days, everyone runs away from hard work when they can't make a profit.

116
00:10:57,598 --> 00:11:01,370
I guess they didn't want to do such a hard job.

117
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:04,964
So why do you keep doing it?

118
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:10,807
Let's see... The road ahead isn't
about making money.

119
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,702
This is a job a man could spend
the rest of his life doing and not regret it.

120
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,079
Whether I get out of debt or not, it doesn't matter.

121
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,387
It all depends on God's will.

122
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:29,868
Anyway, it's important to work in the river until you die.

123
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,952
I don't really get it.

124
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:37,515
Maybe it's still a bit hard for you to understand.

125
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,320
You'll figure it out in time.

126
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:47,678
By the way, it's about this time that the bears come out of their dens looking for food.

127
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,728
You need to be careful when you play alone.

128
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,494
It's okay, Grandpa Rocky.

129
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,516
I have this bow!

130
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,568
My dad taught me how to use it, and I'm really good at it.

131
00:11:57,923 --> 00:12:01,713
Oh, I don't doubt it,
based on what I saw earlier,

132
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:04,936
but you can't go up
against a bear with it.

133
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:09,727
I was born and raised in these woods and by this lake.

134
00:12:10,094 --> 00:12:12,740
There's nothing to be scared of. Well, see ya!

135
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,952
Oh, come back!

136
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:15,232
Watch out, watch out!

137
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,031
I'll be fine!

138
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,330
Wait up!

139
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,610
That's it!

140
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:33,643
Here goes!

141
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,910
Ow...

142
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,430
Wait up!

143
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:40,270
That's it!

144
00:13:37,665 --> 00:13:38,838
It has two legs...

145
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,807
I see. So that's a human. But it's so small.

146
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:45,099
It's a bear cub!

147
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:47,393
You've just been born, haven't you?

148
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,114
There's no need to be scared. Come on, come here.

149
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,160
Oh, right.

150
00:13:58,294 --> 00:13:59,447
You're scared of this, right?

151
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:02,441
See? You're not scared anymore, right?

152
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:09,824
You see?

153
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,033
I'm a friend.

154
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:23,878
Yo.

155
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,156
Kellyan, how are you doing?

156
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:29,546
Hi, Grandpa Rocky.

157
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:31,989
Found any of God's dried rice?

158
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:37,409
It's no good. I think God
still dosen't approve of me.

159
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,675
But the cold water from the
melting ice takes a toll on me.

160
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:45,907
So could I come in and warm myself by your fire?

161
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:48,445
Of course. I'll add some wood to it now.

162
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:57,651
I feel like I've come back to life.

163
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,313
By the way, Kellyan, I just saw Lan.

164
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,092
Yes, he said he was going out to play.

165
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:07,635
But Kellyan, this is the time when bears come out to roam.

166
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:09,898
If he runs into one...

167
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:13,300
What? I told him not to go far, so he'll be fine.

168
00:15:13,718 --> 00:15:18,805
Oh well. That boy's got a lot of energy, and that's what worries me.

169
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,827
So this is a human...

170
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:58,415
Something smells good.

171
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,544
Oh, yeah. Do you like the way this smells?

172
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:41,047
What do you think? Tasty, isn't it?

173
00:16:41,442 --> 00:16:45,194
That candy was given to me by Alice,
a girl who lives on the ranch.

174
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:48,076
Alice is a friend of mine.

175
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:50,558
Let's be friends, too.

176
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:04,080
I guess it can't be helped. You can eat
them all as a sign of our friendship.

177
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:29,385
It's delicious, don't you think?

178
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:37,657
Hey, don't tear it!

179
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,983
Look, it's empty.

180
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:50,939
Look, look! This way, This way!

181
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:52,872
You can't catch me!

182
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:54,640
Come on!

183
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:03,487
Yeah, this way!

184
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:07,455
Come on, come on!

185
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,700
Come on!

186
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:32,068
Look!

187
00:18:32,623 --> 00:18:34,883
Come on, come on!

188
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:01,231
Don't be scared! Scaredy-cat!

189
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,104
Come on, come here.

190
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,045
That tickles!

191
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,601
Brother, where are you?

192
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,256
Hurry up!

193
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,653
Come on, come on!
What are you waiting for?

194
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,942
Something got caught!
Maybe a rabbit or a fox?

195
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:10,899
Well, that's it then.
Sometimes deer fall in by mistake.

196
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:13,296
Oh, that would be great!

197
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,396
Well then, I'm coming with you.

198
00:20:27,446 --> 00:20:31,985
Don't be scared, it'll be okay.
My dad will be here soon.

199
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:38,400
Calm down.

200
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,884
You still haven't gotten over the habit
of sucking on your mother.

201
00:20:52,145 --> 00:20:54,005
By the way, what's your name?

202
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,997
Ah, that's right.

203
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,977
You don't have a name, do you?

204
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,863
I'll give you a name, then.

205
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,407
Let's see...

206
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:06,365
Jack!

207
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,574
Jack is a nice name.

208
00:21:07,911 --> 00:21:09,645
Since you're little, I'll call you Jackie.

209
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:14,192
Jack was the name of my grandpa,
chief of the Motok tribe.

210
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,987
It's Captain Jack's name!

211
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,057
From today onward, you're Jackie.

212
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,826
Hooray for Jackie!

213
00:21:38,073 --> 00:21:39,086
Oh, Kellyan!

214
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,735
Could you please go a little more slowly?

215
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:48,332
I'm good at water.

216
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,313
But I'm too old for this mountain road...

217
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,158
What happened to Jackie,
a bear cub who made friends

218
00:21:58,182 --> 00:22:01,059
with Lan, a human,
for the first time?

219
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,153
They accidentally fell into a trap.

220
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:07,470
But Lan's father and Grandpa Rocky didn't know that.

221
00:22:07,818 --> 00:22:13,470
And the mother bear, Pinto,
was rushing madly to the trap.

222
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:17,078
I'll see you next week for the rest of this story.

223
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:31,921
Lan's father and Grandpa Rocky went to the trap and saw Pinto, the mother bear.

224
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,371
They couldn't move at all.

225
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:40,920
Suddenly, Pinto felt their presence and stood up on her hind legs.

226
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,360
Next time, on Jackie the Bear Cub,

227
00:22:43,885 --> 00:22:46,080
"The Dangers of the Forest" Look forward to it.
