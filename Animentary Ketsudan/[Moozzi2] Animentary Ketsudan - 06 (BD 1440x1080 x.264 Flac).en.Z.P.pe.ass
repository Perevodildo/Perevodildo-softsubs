He was entrusted to conduct additional reconnaissance later that day and had the same conclusion. His commander decided to send a battalion to launch a night attack against the position, and Wakabayashi’s company participated in the attack. He and his men rushed to the top of the Redoubt and he left a marking at the entrance of “Shaftesbury Avenue,” one of the tunnels of the Redoubt. As the action was not approved by the higher command, he was somehow blamed by his regimental commander for taking the position without order, and was forbidden to play an active role throughout the battle. His battalion was sent as the final reserve of the division and was not sent to the Island until 24 December.
