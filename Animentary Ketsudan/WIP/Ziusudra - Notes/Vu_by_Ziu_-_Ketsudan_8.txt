0:01:43.04  Aimed at securing the hold on Rabaul bases, \Nin the view of storming the Australian north,
0:01:49.63  Its first step was the capture of Tulagi island \Nby the special landing party assembled in Rabaul.
0:01:56.23  Being warned in advance of the Japanese attack,\Nthe Australian garrison had already evacuated.
0:02:02.52  The island was entirely vacated. 
0:02:11.38  >> The use of "of" as a preposition after "learning" is unnecessary.
0:02:17.17  immediately dispatched the Lexington carrier's air wings,
0:02:20.57  ordering them to initiate attack.
0:03:11.25  Meanwhile, on Japan's end, \Nin Rabaul's headquarters,
0:03:17.15  essentially directing this operation, \Nwas expecting reports from the front line. 
0:03:31.19  But if carrier-based planes raided us... 
0:03:33.71  It means that the American Mobile Fleet \Nis in position around the Coral Sea.
0:03:52.39  Quite possibly, the enemy \Nis well-informed about our movements,
0:04:03.77  their action is rigidly confined \Nto the Coral Sea. 
0:04:10.14  The elusive American carriers \Nharassing us since the war's outbreak - 
0:04:13.68  would immensely rouse our morale if dealt with. 
0:04:19.17  On May 6, with orders to decisively wipe out \Nthe American Mobile Task Force, 
0:04:23.53  under Rear Admiral Takagi Takeo's leadership, \Nthe Japanese Mobile Task Force advanced into the Coral Sea.
0:04:29.89  From the bridge of the brand new carrier Zuikaku, \Nthe jewel of the Japanese Navy, 
0:04:34.03  Alongside that Rear Admiral, \Nthe Commander of the 5th Carrier Division,
0:04:41.86  That's something I dread for myself. 
            >> To fear, to dread, also in the sense of "to feel absolutely concerned about", it's more about anticipation than bravery.
0:04:43.74  Tomorrow night, upon crossing \Nthe southern tip of San Cristobal Island, 
0:04:47.88  we will enter the Coral Sea from the east.
            >> I corrected it to "will", no need for the conditional tense since it's factual you can access the coral sea from crossing the San Cristobal Island.
0:04:50.10  It's as fishing for a single loach in the Pacific Ocean. 
            >> Fixed. This way the spectator can conclude in this metaphor that a loach is a fish. Besides, I made it to a lower CPS level.
0:04:52.76  Dead right!
            >> A more familiar way to speak, reflecting the original Japanese sentence.
0:05:06.22  the Yorktown and the Lexington
0:05:19.90  readied for a face-off with the Japanese fleet. 
0:05:23.32  At the top \Nof the American Mobile Fleet, Admiral Fletcher,
0:05:26.47  held a debriefing \Naboard the aircraft carrier Yorktown.
0:05:45.95  >> "Still" instead of "however" always helps to lower the CPS
0:05:49.12  At any rate, it dumbs down\N to who locate the other first.
0:05:52.41  Even by a margin of seconds or minutes...
0:06:01.08  Both the Japanese and American fleets \Nwanted the bigger gather step. 
0:06:04.40  Hence both were desperately scouring the area.
0:06:06.87  The next days - the 5th and 6th of May, \Nwere utterly uneventful. 
0:06:12.39  Maybe the enemy is hoping \Nto mow our landing party down tomorrow, 
0:06:15.89  >> The Solomon sea.
0:06:19.35  No, more likely... The day after tomorrow, \Nover at the Coral Sea, as we appear in Port Moresby.
0:06:28.36  Were they to choose that day,
0:06:30.34  they would maneuver on the southern side by tomorrow.
0:06:33.24  This is all but a big game of hide-and-seek.
0:06:38.25  Tomorrow, we need to catch the enemy by the tail \Nand shut them down!
0:06:46.15  In this case, we will have \Nto turn west and cross the Coral Sea.
0:06:49.97  Simultaneously, the Japanese convoys, carrying \Nthe Port Moresby assault party and their escort, 
0:06:56.39  >> The aircraft carrier Shoho, don't forget the article.
0:07:00.00  were sailing south through the center\Nof the Solomon Sea.
0:07:02.90  Until sometime after 9 am an enemy aircraft was spotted \Nand the whole fleet was put on full alert.
0:07:09.72  To all crew! Man your stations! 
0:07:29.40  Thus, the time was gradually drawing near \Nfor History's first carrier-on-carrier battle.
0:07:36.36  It was shipborne! \NThe enemy carrier must be near here!
            >> Why use the weird, longer, valley speak "should totally" when the modal "must" basically means that?
0:07:40.02  Take every precaution so as to not subject us \Nto radio detection, only then search for them! 
0:07:58.37  Enemy aircraft carrier seen! \N400 nautical miles southwest of Tulagi.
0:08:45.33  First, we should launch a full blown attack on the enemy \Ntowards Rossel Island.
0:08:49.40  Meanwhile, escorted by our mobile fleet, \Nthe convoy evades to the northwest.
0:08:55.48  >> Use "yet" instead of "however to lower the CPS
0:09:00.15  They already fully engaged the enemy.
0:10:14.94  >> the carrier Shoho
0:12:25.17  Mistaking a tanker for a carrier \Nis a bridge too far!
0:12:32.52  Communications department, \Nwhat are you doing?!
0:12:35.13  Tell them to double back \Nafter dropping the dimes!
0:12:38.92  We'll fail \Nif we keep dawdling!
0:12:40.90  Get ready to swiftly house the fighter units!
0:12:45.89  to not only chase the enemy in the northwest \Nbut to crush them!
0:13:25.68  We'll be sure to make up for Shoho's loss! 
0:13:37.25  This is a dangerous option.
0:13:53.72  The pilots received severely lacking training, \Nmaking night attack a foolish poke in the dark.
0:14:00.08  >> "To coerce" already involves constraint. Adding the adverb "forcingly" makes it a pleonasm.
0:14:11.28  All right. I place trust in you as the commander.
0:14:17.39  The main force is...
0:14:18.77  to carry out a night strike on the enemy mobile fleet \Npresent in the northern Coral Sea.
0:14:24.39  With our fleet's ace pilots leading,
0:14:31.26  Take off as soon as the preparations are over. \NTriumph over the odds.
0:15:01.79  The Japanese planes \Nhave yet to locate us.
0:15:04.38  Today, our mobile fleet sails \Nunder the protection of the goddess of victory.
            >> The Americans are cocky enough to use present simple as if it's an obvious truth =)
0:15:50.97  Just as all our fighters are away, \Nthey're taunting us!
            >> Just as the comment specifies about consistency, I propose something neutral. 
0:16:29.86  Still unable to discover the enemy. \NUnder heavy fire from enemy fighters.
0:16:34.49  Currently engaging them. 
0:16:36.74  Very high casualties.
0:16:46.12  at any rate, we only have this stupidly big pool here.
0:16:49.20  Yeah, and we're almost in ice-cold.
            >> My understanding of this conversation is that they banter with a parallel between enjoying a casual hot bath and have a mortal dip in the cold seas.
0:16:52.20  60 degrees to the right, friendly carrier!
0:17:26.78  Enemy plane!!
0:18:09.75  Night-time attacks are arduous.
0:18:14.57  Can't be helped now. \NMaybe tomorrow?
0:18:21.58  The Coral Sea Battle went on for a second day.
0:18:26.30  >> no need to add " 's carrier", it's obvious at this point it's their respective priority.
0:18:32.04  I think it's theirs!
0:19:21.90  I'm breaking visual contact with the enemy \Nto turn back.
0:20:11.19  It's best that we light the path for our fold.
0:20:16.65  >> You can delete the first "our"
0:20:24.57  >> "The rest is up to you"
0:20:41.55  Captain, we're out of fuel!
0:22:16.62  As soon as the battle is over, \Ncarrier Zuikaku deigns to appear. 
0:22:29.26  Currently consolidating our forces, \Nwith no prospect for re-attack today.
0:22:33.28  Also, critical shortage in offensive ability and the fuel supply
0:22:37.18  No need to add "the" before nighttime.
0:22:39.62  The recipient of the report \Nwas the Commander-in-Chief of the 4th fleet, Inoue.
0:22:43.71  It's out of our hands, \Nif Shokaku comes under attack.
0:22:46.78  Order them to hold siege and head north.
0:23:26.53  The reason was of Operation Midway, planned next, which was soon due to to take place.
0:23:32.32  His commander frustrated him, \Nby letting another big victory slip away.
0:23:36.73  Damage-wise, both the Japanese and US sides \Nsuffered approximately even losses.
0:23:43.02  By overly watching for your allies' safety,
0:23:45.96  you lose track of outgunning the enemy, \Nand let the outcome end in a stalemate.
0:23:51.07  This time, the 4th Fleet of the IJN emerged victorious \Ntactics-wise, yet being beaten strategy-wise.
0:24:09.57  The reason behind the sudden war on the Pacific \Nwas the dominion over the oil-rich southern regions.
