1. 0:02:13.21 First Battle of the Solomon Islands {doesn't say islands so I'm unsure if that's the right wording}{第1次ソロモン海戦}

2. 0:03:17.39 With the top performance of the enemy planes in mind, \Nthey'd only be able to harass us from above {lit: exist in our sky - I hope he means this - 敵機の性能上から見て我々の上空にいるのはせいぜい20分か30分足らずに過ぎないのだ}

"With the ceiling of..." feels more apt her since they care about the altitude that can be achieved. 

3. 0:06:05.60 The transfer of land-based attack aircraft \Nfrom Misawa Air Group is also scheduled. {not sure what to make of shinshitsu: 陸航機隊が進出してくることになっておる} {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misawa_Air_Group}

4. 0:07:23.73 and 1st Air Wing with 18 Zero fighters \Nfor departure at 07:30. {unsure he means this, just "0730 takeoff"}

5. 0:07:27.79 3rd Air Wing with 9 naval bombers \Nshould depart as soon as it's ready! {no clue what's kanbaku here, assumed it's an abbreviation: kan(ship)baku[hatsu](explosion); just "aircraft" in HA}

6. 0:08:21.04 Ever since the battle of Midway, \Nour navy has been scared out of their wits. {no clue what's shougi here, believing HA's "too cowardly"}

7. 0:09:22.31 Order the flagship with all the senior staff, \Nas well as the 6th Air Group to sortie immediately. {no clue what's choukai here, assumed "chou(officer)kai(assembly)" but it's not in dictionary}

8. 0:12:46.40 Full to starboard! Hurry! {no clue what's mikaji here, was "full to port" in HA, but if they're going from Rabaul south, it'd make sense to turn right to pretend to head northwest, not left}

9. 0:14:14.72
It takes too much time. Harass them with the 8-inch guns, \Nsince it doesn't matter at this point. {unsure what he means by "because I don't care" - prolly means "I don't mind spending shells on it"} {/threaten/scare away}

10. 0:15:16.62
And at around 14:30, it returned to its home base \Nin Milne Bay on the southern tip of New Guinea. {not sure what's ittan here}

11. 0:18:27.21
Copy that! {was "illumination" in HA but I only hear "sousa" (is that so?), tho I might be wrong}

12. 0:20:38.30
Attack! Attack! {no clue what he means by "charge; rush; dash; assault; attack", maybe "return fire"?}

13. 0:21:36.04
It'd be impossible to escape the enemy carrier's retaliation. {hope he means this: 敵空母から逃れることは不可能です - maybe he means now, maybe "... would be impossible to run away from after 4am"}
