Oyashio, Kuroshio, Kawakaze, Suzukaze, and Kagero - \Neach one of the 5 ships was loaded with about 220 drums. {nc what's bunsai}

2. 0:03:43.64
And then, we'll have a free hand \Nto do the one thing we excel at. {その間に無事ドラム艦を投下し、その後で存分に日頃の腕を振るってもらう。 - lit is "[if we encounter the enemy, the patrols would fight them off,] meanwhile we drop the barrels safely and have someone show off their habitual/daily skill/proficiency to their heart's content" - very unsure, but assumed "and after we drop the drums, our crews will engage spectacularly in a skillful night battle, that we've trained them for daily" because that's how it was irl}

They're no mere shipping agency. You'll see. {unsure why they laugh, maybe some joke here, but I don't get it: take a look}

4. 0:06:22.31
Though it makes perfect sense to us, {no clue what he means: though I say leave this to me,}

Bearing - 175 degrees. \NFull to starboard! {nc whats orose, believing HA}

6. 0:07:09.41
331 degrees 20 minutes! {no clue what's 20 here, he doesn't actually say minutes; maybe it's not futamaru at all, not in hA}

7. 0:07:23.05
All crew, anti-aircraft combat! \NMan your positions! {believing HA, nc what's actually ichinitsuke}

8. 0:09:24.62
4 nautical miles west of Savo Island, \Nthey've been approaching at a 180 degrees course. {no clue what it means here, 180 degrees is basically backwards so it doesn't make sense from any point of view; maybe he means "they've decided to do a 180 later" bc that's what happened irl, but he clearly speaks in past tense here; 進路180度でガダルカナル島前面に侵入することにした}

They know that if they don't come by midnight, \Nthe planes from the base would be after them. {no clue what he means: 24時までに来なければ基地の飛行機に捕まるのを知っているからな - probably that the japanese have to leave or else the planes from tulagi would reach them after the sun rises;}

10. 0:11:18.74
And if they left there, they {\i1}must{\i0} come here. {again unsure: 出撃しているなら必ず来る - if they're on the sortie, they'll definitely come}

11. 0:12:21.99
If only we deliver those 10 days' worth of provision... {no clue what he means: just prepare 10 days of food / 食料10日の準備だけはしておく}

12. 0:13:21.06
Cardinal direction - 45 degrees to the left. {nc whats kaku after houi and why he says "yonijuugo do" - that'd be "425 degrees"}

12. 0:13:23.18
Enemy speed is 24 knots! {again no clue why he says "24 knots 50" and what to make of 50, maybe "24.5"? seems too precise for such a distance. unfortunately, this is not in wiki}

13. 0:13:33.68
Adjust the settings. Counting on you! {no clue what's before tanomu, was "It's all set. I'll leave it." in HA, I don't see how it may have anything to do with makeup/decoration; dressing; veneer}
