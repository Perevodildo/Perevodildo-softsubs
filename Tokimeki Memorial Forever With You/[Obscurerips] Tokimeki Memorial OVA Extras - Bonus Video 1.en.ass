Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.50,0:00:05.00,Sign,,0,0,0,,An interview with Shiho Kikuchi, \Nvoice of Miharu Tatebayashi
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.00,0:00:10.26,Default,,0,0,0,,When the girls from the game \Ncome to life in animation,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.41,0:00:18.55,Sign,,0,0,0,,What is your impression of the OVA?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.26,0:00:13.45,Default,,0,0,0,,I can't help but get super excited, \Nlike "what it would be like?"
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.45,0:00:15.62,Default,,0,0,0,,But when I come to the studio, \NI forget everything!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.62,0:00:20.40,Default,,0,0,0,,When the characters appeared one by one,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.40,0:00:26.04,Default,,0,0,0,,there were cheers of “Waa! Waa!” during the recording session.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.79,0:00:33.20,Default,,0,0,0,,The impression I got was that they were all incredibly beautiful.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.20,0:00:39.54,Default,,0,0,0,,I remember the animators and director saying they paid attention to even a single strand of hair.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.64,0:00:45.94,Default,,0,0,0,,They really brought out \Neach character’s traits—
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.94,0:00:52.76,Default,,0,0,0,,with beauty, elegance, \Nand a touch of sadness.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.72,0:00:57.72,Default,,0,0,0,,I think it was one of those moments that made me cry without meaning to.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.89,0:01:05.10,Sign,,0,0,0,,It was an unhappy ending, wasn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.72,0:01:02.22,Default,,0,0,0,,As for Tatebayashi, the ending is always like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.22,0:01:10.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Both in the CD drama and this OVA, \Nthe ending is kind of sad.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.22,0:01:17.56,Default,,0,0,0,,I think Miharu-chan has a really strong sense of compassion.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.56,0:01:23.38,Default,,0,0,0,,So there’s this Miharu-chan who’s been watching over the person she likes, the protagonist, all along.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.38,0:01:26.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Rather than her own happiness, \Nshe finds joy in someone else’s happiness...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.69,0:01:33.34,Default,,0,0,0,,In his happiness, and I think she’s the kind of girl who can truly feel content through that.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.99,0:01:38.62,Default,,0,0,0,,In a way, maybe she has a slightly passive or weak side because of that,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.62,0:01:41.22,Default,,0,0,0,,but at her core, I believe she’s incredibly strong.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.04,0:01:47.24,Sign,,0,0,0,,You sang the insert song "Rain," didn't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.24,0:01:50.08,Default,,0,0,0,,When I heard there was going to be a recording,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.78,0:01:53.76,Default,,0,0,0,,I received the materials for the song and read the lyrics,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.76,0:01:55.78,Default,,0,0,0,,and also when I listened to the song,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.78,0:02:05.09,Default,,0,0,0,,I thought it was a bit different from the usual Tokimeki Memorial character songs.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.09,0:02:12.50,Default,,0,0,0,,It was more of a whispery voice kind of song, a sad, really sad kind of song.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.50,0:02:15.88,Default,,0,0,0,,I had heard that the song would be used in the OVA,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.88,0:02:18.42,Default,,0,0,0,,and I wondered what kind of scene it would appear in.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.42,0:02:21.28,Default,,0,0,0,,When the rainy scene started and the song played,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.28,0:02:23.08,Default,,0,0,0,,I thought, “Ah, that makes sense.”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.08,0:02:25.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Story-wise,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.78,0:02:31.18,Default,,0,0,0,,Miharu-chan has kind of an unhappy ending,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.18,0:02:34.64,Default,,0,0,0,,but the fact that she was given that song...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.64,0:02:36.52,Default,,0,0,0,,I think that in itself must mean she’s happy.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.80,0:02:52.50,Sign,,0,0,0,,What were the past five years like \Nfor Tatebayashi Miharu and Kikuchi Shiho?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.90,0:02:44.80,Default,,0,0,0,,When I first got the role,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.80,0:02:49.04,Default,,0,0,0,,her character description read something like “a girl who keeps watching the protagonist
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.04,0:02:51.72,Default,,0,0,0,,from the shadows, undeterred by wind or rain.”
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.41,0:02:57.78,Default,,0,0,0,,And the script had only about 10 pages of lines—
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.78,0:03:00.74,Default,,0,0,0,,compared to everyone else, it was really, really little.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.74,0:03:04.62,Default,,0,0,0,,But when I was given the chance to sing “Journey Song” the other day,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.62,0:03:07.96,Default,,0,0,0,,I had a lot more lines and got to speak a lot.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.96,0:03:16.14,Default,,0,0,0,,So I feel like, in terms of Tatebayashi’s story, \Nher dialogue gradually increased over time.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.14,0:03:22.24,Default,,0,0,0,,While other characters confessed their feelings and moved their stories forward,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.24,0:03:27.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Miharu-chan still ends up with the same sad ending—she stays in the same place.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.34,0:03:36.20,Default,,0,0,0,,But I’m sure that emotionally, with every story she completes, she grows a little stronger.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.92,0:03:44.02,Default,,0,0,0,,Even though five years have passed, she hasn’t aged, \Njust kept looping through those three years.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.02,0:03:53.36,Default,,0,0,0,,So in that sense, I think I, Kikuchi Shiho, \Nhave probably grown emotionally too.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.90,0:04:00.98,Default,,0,0,0,,It feels like the two of us, in totally different worlds, have been running in sync, side by side.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.98,0:04:05.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Having come this far and finished the OVA, that’s kind of how I feel.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.11,0:04:09.12,Sign,,0,0,0,,Will we ever see you again?\N(From a fan)
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.12,0:04:15.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Your perspective and feelings toward Tokimeki Memorial,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.14,0:04:18.48,Default,,0,0,0,,compared to five years ago, have probably changed little by little, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.48,0:04:24.18,Default,,0,0,0,,This may be the end in form,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.18,0:04:30.30,Default,,0,0,0,,but I think the feelings of us, the cast, the staff who created it, and the players
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.87,0:04:35.92,Default,,0,0,0,,should be carried forward into the next form, the next incarnation of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.92,0:04:39.44,Default,,0,0,0,,That all depends on how we feel about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.44,0:04:42.44,Default,,0,0,0,,So rather than thinking of this as the end,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.44,0:04:46.60,Default,,0,0,0,,let’s treat it as a turning point to find a new form.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.15,0:04:51.68,Default,,0,0,0,,I hope everyone will continue to support us with your feelings.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.68,0:04:54.43,Default,,0,0,0,,I’m looking forward to the day we meet again.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.43,0:04:55.83,Default,,0,0,0,,This was Kikuchi Shiho.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.03,0:04:58.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Bye-bye!
