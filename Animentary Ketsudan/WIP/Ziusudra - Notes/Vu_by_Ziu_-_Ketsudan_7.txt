0:01:50.06 >> Wrong preposition. "on" instead of "at"
0:01:52.57 >> no need to add the article "the" in front of Britain since it's a country. The narrator speaks about past events, so it's the past tense ("was" instead of is)
0:01:59.89 >> still consistency: past tense "arrived" not "arrive"
0:02:04.95 >> "comprised of" not "comprised by". The Prince of Wales is regarded as an unique battleship, so it's "the battleship Prince of Wales".
0:02:07.33 and the battlecruiser Repulse, \Nthey stood ready to protect the colony.
0:02:11.80 >> "had been" for tense consistency. Present perfect is used for actions that may still be taking place as the narrator currently speaks, which is obviously not the case.
0:02:14.38 clearing any doubt \Nabout Singapore's defenses being impregnable.
0:02:35.73 Through its on-board cutting-edge technology, her unsinkable reputation spanned across the globe. 
0:02:56.73 anti-aircraft guns with a 6000 rounds firing rate per minute,
0:02:59.93 >> You forgot the past tense there: "were" not "are".
0:03:11.35 Though outclassed, it was recently refitted \Nwith equipment akin to that of Prince of Wales.
0:03:18.47 >> You can ditch the "the" in front of Hainan island.
0:03:25.38 The Prince of Wales and the Repulse are anchored in Singapore.
0:03:28.35 >> Use "surely" as an adverb instead to lower the CPS level. "Now" may be suppressed as well.
0:03:30.62 Surprise is our goal. \NMaking the landing a secret is a must.
0:03:33.61 However, with those still around, attempt at landing under the enemy's radar involves more risk.
0:03:38.87 Yes. With the British East Indies Fleet still in the area, \Nthe Army supply's sea route is jeopardized. 
0:03:44.30 The British fleet needs priority elimination.
0:03:54.62 If needs be, our escort fleet will sacrifice for the purpose,
0:03:57.52 in order to get our landing party all set.
0:04:23.51 >> You can choose to edit out "ultimate" as Singapore as a goal is already self explanatory. It improves the CPS being at 18.
0:04:36.80 >> A choice of word, but I prefer "rear" as a verb over "stick".
0:04:40.93 the enemy must be fidgeting while radioing Singapore with a "\Nlarge Japanese formation spotted" right now.
0:04:52.81 they'll trudge through our mines in the seas, west of the Anambas Archipelago.
0:04:58.73 And in the dim chance they turn up from the East, Nthey'll just end up in the tight snare of our submarine fleet. 
0:05:06.02 if the British were to\Nunveil our surprise landing,
0:05:08.62 it would spell trouble for the entire campaign. 
0:05:13.12 As per our plan, we'll induce a bogus report,
0:05:15.63 hinting at a course towards Thailand. 
0:05:26.54 >> You can drop the "the" article before composition.
0:05:40.63 >> "in doubt" the expression is always to be worded in singular form.
0:06:05.47 The Japanese troops done landing last night \Ncan only have one target in their crosshairs - Singapore.
0:06:13.48 The Japanese know that a seaborne attack \Nwould not cut it to tear apart a fortress as Singapore.
0:06:19.75 >> You can edit out the first "the" before pride. I have no idea on how to make the sentence any shorter, though.
0:06:22.59 to launch a sneak attack, under Air Force coverage,
0:06:25.99 Shredding the Japanese fleet.
0:06:27.62 The Japanese battleships are flanked\Nby 20 warships. 
0:06:39.04 When we meet the enemy, \Nwe strike decisively, hitting hard. 
0:06:54.20 >> Same remark, add a "the" article before Prince of Wales.
0:07:31.74 >> Using the article "a" instead of "the" for surprise attack is preferable. Otherwise, it sounds silly as if going for a surprise attack is "doing the worm" move or something.
0:07:38.02 The Japanese also know that passing them \Nfrom the west would be the obvious call.
0:07:42.62 So the way may be littered with mines.
0:07:51.83 >> You forgot to word the sentence in the past tense as the narrator speaks.
0:08:45.48 >> Same remark about adding an article before the ships name.
0:08:48.69 >> You may edit out "just" to help the CPS level a little.
0:08:54.92 Print the reconnaissance photos. It's urgent.
0:09:11.14 >> Same remark about adding an article before the ships name.
0:09:59.74 >> Another minor grammar correction add a "the" before "safety".
0:10:06.22 >> Add a "the" before "heavy cruiser".
0:10:08.92 >> "set out" not "sets out" as the narrator speaks in past tense.
0:10:18.93 We'll be all-time heroes, \Nsinking the Prince of Wales.
           >> I love the original wording, but it has a heavy CPS level.
0:11:30.52 the torpedo bombers that took off from the Indochina bases \Nspotted a fleet they identified as the Z-Force. 
0:12:10.50 We've had a snafu\N of friendly ships mistaken as the enemy. 
0:12:22.74 buying that the Japanese scout aircraft \Nfound them, was falling back.
0:12:27.08 >> "Regardless", "However" is correct but you are overusing the formula slightly.
0:12:28.09 >> "The Z-Force".
0:12:34.33 >> I personally prefer the use of "mysteriously", as suggested in the comment.
0:12:54.94 Having abandoned the prospect of a surprise attack, the Z-Force \Ndoubled back to Singapore.
0:13:12.04 The report says, hostile landing in Kuantan.
0:13:22.21 An airborne threat is of low probability. 
0:13:24.41 Both the enemy convoys and escort vessels \Nare ours! 
           >> Most CPS friendly wording
0:13:27.91 Alright. This time, no sidestep. 
0:13:30.45 >> "send a destroyer ahead". Why saying "send one destroyer ahead" when you can word it to make it to 15 CPS?
0:13:33.93 >> Don't forget to put the "the" in front of Z-Force. Otherwise, it's worded like it's the nickname of a pro-wrestler or something along the lines.
0:13:39.14 with the hope to take the wind out of the Japanese fleet, \Nthe Z-Force set out.
0:13:45.24 >> The Z-force
0:13:48.34 of the presence of a Japanese submarine I-58, \Nobserving their every move.
0:13:54.02 They won't get away scot free this time.
0:13:56.01 Keep shadowing them until the very end.
0:13:58.03 Once they're found, \Nlaunch a full-scale attack.
0:14:04.22 Quiet The Prince of Wales and the Repulse by air!
0:14:09.34 >> You may delete "at once" without it harming contextually the sentence too much. Long live low CPS!
0:14:28.81 >> The British Z-Force
0:14:37.10 We've been at it for five hours already.
0:14:47.34 You're in a hurry to go?
           >> I like the original sentence, but it is CPS heavy, so it's better to stick to the more literal sense imo.
0:14:48.80 We keep going until we hammer it. 
0:14:51.47 Malay shore in sight!
0:15:00.25 At that moment, dim shadows darted across the pilot's field of vision. 
0:15:08.82 Conceal us amid the clouds.
0:15:20.25 No doubt about it! It's the Prince of Wales and the Repulse!
0:15:46.06 Reconnaissance is such a bore!
0:15:50.86 Reconnaissance and sink jobs \Nare equal in value!
0:15:54.77 Alright. Stay watchful \Nuntil our attack planes arrive.
0:16:08.36 >> There's no need to complement the sentence with "with plane". It's obvious, otherwise how are they supposed to do it? They eject and fire a rocket launcher?
0:16:14.39 Make it a firework!
0:16:29.59 We should definitely expect an airborne attack.
0:16:32.14 The Prince of Wales fears not \Nthis kind of rain.
0:16:35.91 The enemy is fierce.
0:16:37.03 We must oppose them spotlessly.
0:16:38.64 We're golden, no matter when the attack happens.
0:16:40.98 It's time to show what iron the Royal Navy is made of. 
0:16:43.43 Every single enemy plane \Nmust fall apart.
0:17:34.63 Thus eight planes of the Japanese air squadron \Ntook position 3,000 meters above the Repulse.
0:18:00.73 Bomb hitting the Repulse, confirmed!
0:18:37.30 Two torpedoes! Hits on the Prince of Wales, confirmed!
0:18:45.85 The propellers stopped working!
0:18:48.62 Give them hell! \NFight until the very last man!
0:19:18.86 "Under heavy bombardment by Japanese aviation."
0:19:22.95 The British are striking back very hard.
0:19:25.10 As expected from their "unsinkable battleship!"
0:19:27.85 you the 8 of the 8th squadron,
0:20:16.90 The British fleet was resisting \Nwith tremendous tenacity.
0:20:22.07 The Repulse
0:20:32.67 All staff to muster on the upper deck. \NAbandon ship!
0:20:58.49 The Repulse
0:21:06.26 The Prince of Wales
0:21:36.92 To all staff, abandon ship!
0:21:45.73 The staff is done with the process.
0:21:51.56 as the paladins of the British Empire.
0:21:56.14 Captain! hurry up and come aboard!
0:21:59.36 No, I'm good staying here.
0:22:22.82 The Prince of Wales
0:22:42.11 Are they out of bullets?
0:22:53.33 Our aviation sunk an unsinkable battleship.
0:22:57.19 >> You may delete "but" to meet a CPS level of 15
0:23:12.60 The next day, a Japanese plane surveyed the sinking site \Nof the Prince of Wales and the Repulse.
0:23:23.78 Both the Japanese British fleets fought splendidly, \Nimpressing one another with majestic resolution.
           >> Keep "fleets" nonetheless, the Japanese people are all about team work and even without the presence of the Japanese ships on the battle sites, they helped to kickstart the aviation's winning effort..
0:23:31.21 One of the wreathes saluted \Nthe British soldiers.
0:23:34.20 With the other dedicated \Nto the fallen Japanese soldiers.
0:23:37.75 The wreathes symbolized the respect for everyone's uncompromising drive to fulfill their duty.
0:23:47.13 in a way, the Japanese Navy's tribute ushered in the age of aircraft. 
0:23:52.59 And before long, short-sightedness \Nwould also spell a major disaster for them. 
0:24:08.90 Next time's backdrop, in the Southern Pacific, \Nis the Coral Sea.
0:24:14.97 will birth the first ever instance of a \Ncarrier-on-carrier battle.
0:24:19.75 With Zeros and Grummans culminating towards a dogfight.
           >> Got to ditch the "spectacular" adjective to meet a decent CPS level. But it's self explanatory that the first ever carrier-on-carrier leads to spectacular outcome, I'd say.
0:24:28.00 the Japanese and American task forces \Nwould fight to their last bits of wit.
