Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.07,0:00:09.41,Default,,0,0,0,,At first, she was such a perfect girl
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.41,0:00:13.18,Default,,0,0,0,,that I couldn’t even tell \Nhow her emotions rose and fell,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.18,0:00:18.90,Default,,0,0,0,,or whether she ever felt things like hatred toward someone or deep sadness.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.90,0:00:23.62,Default,,0,0,0,,I wasn’t even sure if she \Nwas capable of such feelings.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.62,0:00:29.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I thought maybe I had to portray her in this very neat, flawless way.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.00,0:00:30.52,Default,,0,0,0,,That’s what I was thinking at the beginning.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.52,0:00:33.86,Default,,0,0,0,,But through the drama CDs and
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.86,0:00:39.92,Default,,0,0,0,,all the different routes of Tokimeki Memorial, Shiori-chan, too, experienced many different episodes.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.92,0:00:44.71,Default,,0,0,0,,And through that, I also started to understand how she would feel about things.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.71,0:00:46.55,Default,,0,0,0,,How should I put it…
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.11,0:00:53.69,Default,,0,0,0,,It felt like I could see the subtle folds of her heart, especially in this OVA.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.16,0:01:07.90,Sign,,0,0,0,,What was the intention behind the lyrics for the episode #2's opening theme "Beginning?"
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.90,0:01:15.11,Default,,0,0,0,,Starting with the game, Tokimeki Memorial as a series expanded into things like CDs and radio dramas—
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.11,0:01:16.64,Default,,0,0,0,,it’s had many different branches.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.74,0:01:23.98,Default,,0,0,0,,And through all of those, each character has gone through worries, and had fun, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.35,0:01:29.36,Default,,0,0,0,,But up to this point, we hadn’t really shown the very human side—
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.36,0:01:34.53,Default,,0,0,0,,those inner struggles, like wondering what is everyone going to do in the future.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.53,0:01:36.66,Default,,0,0,0,,It didn’t feel like we’d explored that before.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.80,0:01:43.80,Default,,0,0,0,,But in Volume 1, you can see the characters worrying about their future paths and love lives.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.87,0:01:47.06,Default,,0,0,0,,And I also thought, \N“Yeah, that’s how it is at that age.”
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.06,0:01:50.34,Default,,0,0,0,,So I also found myself cheering for them.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.35,0:01:54.15,Default,,0,0,0,,I wanted to create a kind of cheer song for the character.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.15,0:01:57.42,Default,,0,0,0,,That was the feeling I had when writing the lyrics.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.28,0:02:30.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Among those who’ve watched the video,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.46,0:02:34.85,Default,,0,0,0,,I think there might still be some who haven’t realized this yet,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.85,0:02:38.18,Default,,0,0,0,,but that Tokimeki Memorial OVA has a lot of foreshadowing woven into it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.89,0:02:42.24,Default,,0,0,0,,And one of those is the CD listening scene.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.02,0:02:44.33,Default,,0,0,0,,I think it was Volume 1?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.33,0:02:52.01,Default,,0,0,0,,Shiori-chan receives a CD as a birthday present from the boy she likes.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.21,0:02:56.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Wait, no—it’s Volume 2. \NThat scene appears in Volume 2.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.14,0:03:01.95,Default,,0,0,0,,So she receives it, and she says, \N“This is a CD I really wanted. Thank you.”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.72,0:03:06.95,Default,,0,0,0,,That CD—in scene where Shiori-chan is studying,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.95,0:03:12.63,Default,,0,0,0,,she always plays that CD while she studies.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.63,0:03:15.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course, part of it
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.66,0:03:20.40,Default,,0,0,0,,is because she likes the music, but more than that, she cherishes it because it came from someone she likes.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.40,0:03:23.47,Default,,0,0,0,,And in the very first classical music listening session,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.47,0:03:25.97,Default,,0,0,0,,she’s actually playing that same CD.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.97,0:03:28.34,Default,,0,0,0,,She doesn’t talk about it much in depth,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.34,0:03:35.71,Default,,0,0,0,,but at the end of Volume 1, she realizes, “That’s right, I love him,”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.71,0:03:42.32,Default,,0,0,0,,and from there, as she begins to try and convey or nurture those feelings,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.32,0:03:46.63,Default,,0,0,0,,that CD becomes a very important, symbolic piece of music.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.63,0:03:49.73,Sign,,0,0,0,,Will we ever meet again?\N(From a fan)
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.73,0:03:57.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Many of you may be wondering, “Does that mean the world of Kirameki High School is gone now?”
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.70,0:03:59.50,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, who knows?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.64,0:04:07.24,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, from my perspective, \NPart 2 is a new story set in the neighboring town,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.24,0:04:12.36,Default,,0,0,0,,but at the same time, Shiori-chan’s world will continue to expand in parallel.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.36,0:04:16.32,Default,,0,0,0,,So with your honest vote \Nfor an interesting project,{清き一票}
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.32,0:04:20.24,Default,,0,0,0,,maybe the interaction between the towns will deepen more and more,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.24,0:04:24.14,Default,,0,0,0,,and a huge new drama might be born.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.14,0:04:29.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Who knows—maybe Shiori-chan and the new heroine from Part 2
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.90,0:04:35.18,Default,,0,0,0,,will sing a duet together, or even have a kind of rivalry or battle.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.18,0:04:37.18,Default,,0,0,0,,Please look forward to that.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.18,0:04:39.50,Default,,0,0,0,,I know I always say all sorts of things off the cuff,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.50,0:04:42.28,Default,,0,0,0,,and I always end up causing trouble for Konami...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.28,0:04:46.10,Default,,0,0,0,,So let’s see how Konami handles everything I’ve just said!
