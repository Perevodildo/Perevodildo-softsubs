If you set your heart on the road less traveled

You must have a man's courage

Sweat, bleed, and never reveal your tears

00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:04,929
Go, go, Hyuuma!

Stop!

00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:35,975
We'll get you!

12
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:38,482
Stop right there!

13
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:47,923
Please show forgiveness!

14
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:49,675
If I join your gang,

15
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,905
I'll get spanked back at home!

00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:56,409
Think you can get away after
turning down an offer from Akagawa?!

17
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:57,373
Quit messing with me!

18
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:03,081
Please show forgiveness!

19
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,354
You should have seen this coming to you!

20

Who did it?!

21
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:16,256
This bastard Hoshi!

22
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:18,807
I'd like you to stop hindering my nap.

23
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,250
Keep it quiet down here.

24
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,000
That's what I threw this one for.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,830
I'm fed up enough as it is
with dad raising a ruckus every night.

26
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:29,457
To show up and rebel against me...

27
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:31,272
Hoshi, you've got some nerve, too!

28
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:33,595
Let's get him...

29
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:34,337
That's right!

Keep going!

00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:45,772
Is this enough to send you trembling in fear?!

34
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:50,892
I have on my side the advantage
of having a perfect aim.

35
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:51,872
So, wanna continue?

Wanna go or not, decide right now!

You saved us, Hoshi.

Why are you letting this happen, Akiko?

51

You have any idea what you've done today?

52

What do you mean?

53
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm talking about what you've done
at the riverside today.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,454
Ah, that thing?

55
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,890
You must have seen yourself then -
nothing serious.

Cretin!

57
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,360
How many times do I have to tell you this?

58
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,237
You can't be showing off your strength in public.

59
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:15,880
Is it that hard to understand?

60
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,822
Have you forgotten?

61
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,278
Enough already, I understand that much.

62
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:21,418
Na-ah, you don't understand a thing.

63
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,261
Look there, at that star.

64
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:27,000
Your aim is to climb up to that constellation.

00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:32,393
As the Star of the Giants, you're bound
to start shining among their ranks.

But until that day comes, you have no choice,

68
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:36,814
but to practice strenuously
without anyone finding out.

Screw the giants.

is a way to make dad and sis happy.

But please, stop quarreling with your father.

81
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,455
Not my fault dad is so selfish.

82
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:19,250
Just 'cause he failed at it himself,
he now wants me to give it a try.

83
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,435
Say, but isn't that excusable for him?

84
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:23,169
If you take his baseball away,

85
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:24,854

86
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:27,314

To let you inherit his baseball
has been dad's dream all along!

world of opportunities!

00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:46,205

97
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,000
I can do it.

98

But remember, sis.

99
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:54,045

to facilitate your covert practice.

We'll add one more on the top.

to hop easily over this.

Nothing serious.

Hoshi, who always had
the most developed reflexes in this class,

123
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:06,923
suddenly trips over today?

124
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:10,734
And now, we proceed to gymnastics on the mat.

125
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:13,028
We'll start with Hoshi
demonstrating you what to do.

126
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,113

132

Hoshi! Enough, you can stop.

Damn, damn it all! It was dad's fault!

That sure was a pitiful performance today.

Well, trust me to help. I know
just the place where you can get your fill...

140
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:18,123
I mean, your dad spends all his money on booze,
so no wonder you're malnourished.

141
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,468
This time you've been so hungry,
you couldn't even do your famous handstand!

142

Got you covered, covered.
Got you, alright?

143
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,073
You don't know what you're saying!

144
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,560
My dad would never spend his last copper
on booze over spending it on provisions for kids!

145
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,637
He doesn't earn much, but he has a big heart!

146
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:41,409
But aren't you the one always complaining
about how unbearable your da is?

147
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,379
That is but the evidence
of how much I value my dad.

148
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:47,000
You can say whatever on my account,

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,399
but if you dare badmouth my dad,
I'll shut you up!

150
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:55,154
Hey you, looking for a fight?

151
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:03,670
Look!

152
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,806
What now? I'm supposed to be impressed?

153
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:20,000
Trying it on would be more compelling.

154
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,927
Like this. What do you think?

155
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:36,063
Hooligan chief Akagawa, what do you think?
Can you do a handstand like this?

156
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:40,400
Hoshi, do you mean to say
you were doing handstand with this thing on?

157
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:42,711
Well, whatever.

158
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:45,000
But if you don't want to reap my wrath,

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,468
you'd better be hush-hush about this whole thing.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,858

00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,481
That's one fine invention dad came up with.

164
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,000
Seems like he's not actually half-bad.

00:10:15,805 --> 00:10:17,940
The guy you tasked me with recruiting.

168
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,567
Terribly sorry I couldn't be
of any service this time.

169
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,228
No-no, that was actually a good progress.

170
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:29,717
Just getting him to show us this dreadful Major
League plaster cast is quite an achievement.

171
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:34,529
You proved yourself worthy of being a scout 
for our Black Shadows baseball delinquents team.

The way things are looking now,
we must do our damnest

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,292
to get him to join our baseball team.

174

00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,532
Know where dad went?

00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,260
You seem mighty impatient!
What's wrong?

182
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,762
As if anything is right at all!

183
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:08,494
Today I'm giving dad
a decisively rough side of the tongue!

184
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,295
There's no way I can keep wearing
this plaster cast!

185
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:16,814
While vaulting over the horse,
I tripped over and fell flat.

186
00:11:16,814 --> 00:11:20,317
And while doing handstand, everyone
burst laughing at my crooked handstand!

187
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:25,087
No wonder at all.

188
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:28,511
After all, this stupid plaster cast
reduces my strength to one tenth of it!

189
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:34,099
There's no way he left without you noticing.
Tell me, where did dad go?

190
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:36,893
Father has not returned from work yet!

191
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:41,877
After enchaining Hyuuma
in this excruciating plaster cast,

192
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:43,899
he couldn't bear to be dawdling around.

193
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,671
He is your father, after all.

194
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,899
Whatever suffering you're going through,
he is experiencing it as well.

195
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,759
Okay? Please.

196
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,761
At least when father is at home,

197
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:54,679
put on that plaster cast.

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,328
I was sure he's drinking his day away
just like always.

199
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:06,138
Was already thinking through
the ensuing quarrel.

200
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:08,182
Thank you, Hyuuma.

201
00:12:08,182 --> 00:12:09,199
I'm home.

202
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:10,217
Welcome back.

203
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,445
I worked not one, but two shifts today.

204
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:17,000
Go buy some meat and cook it for Hyuuma.

205
00:12:19,825 --> 00:12:21,110
And now...

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,232
Hey, Hyuuma. Until dinner, we're having 
a pitching practice in the backyard.

207
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,836
But what about "not letting others
see my hand in baseball, ever?"

208
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,232
Don't you always say that?

209
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:36,797
We'll do it with plaster cast on.

210
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,117
This way, everyone would think
you're just some sub-par baseball player.

211
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:43,699
Hyuuma...

212
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:48,140
Alright, let's play a quick one.

213
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:58,315
Okay, Hyuuma, go ahead.

214
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:27,615
Who'd think it would come to this.

215
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:29,278
Before, he did nothing but boozing.

216
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,176
But now they're playing catch ball every night.

217
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:35,000
Moreover, now that I look at it,
pops and son's play is getting better by the day.

218
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,618
Crap, we've got an audience.

219
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:43,915
Like father like son, after all.
Both are butterfingered in baseball.

220
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:48,211
Dad would even go to such extremes,
just to keep the whole thing a secret.

221
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:51,000
Don't rely on fingers only,
throw it with your whole body.

222
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:55,504
In the end, what the worth of such pitcher?

223
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:56,676
It's a kindergarten level!

224
00:13:58,224 --> 00:13:59,550
You're so obnoxious!

225
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,169
Watch closely, as I'm throwing a blazing fastball
​ that'll blow you away!

226
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:06,000
All I need to do is to free myself
from this damned thing!

227
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:08,415
Hyuuma!

228
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:10,217
Don't tell me

229
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:13,753
you were seriously about to show everyone
the plaster cast just to put them in place?

230
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:15,463
Isn't that so?

231
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:17,932
I won't show it to anyone.

232
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:20,492
That's better.

233
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:21,927
What terrifies me

234
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,288
is that you may disclose yourself to the world,
while you're still too green.

235
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:29,625
Remember? Your conquest
is none other than the Star of the Giants.

236
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:33,244
Hanagata, something wrong?

237
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:36,914
Have you seen it? Hoshi can throw like that
even while wearing a plaster cast.

238
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:39,983
I can't even imagine what his throw
would be like without the cast.

239
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:43,486
Don't you worry. We'll definitely
recruit Hoshi for Black Shadows.

240
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,405
I doubt that my strategy is in any way faulty.

241
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,449
'Cause it ain't!

242
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:18,624
Thanks for the meal!

243
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,687
Who'd think such breakfasts
that we spend together as a family

244
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:26,459
would become a usual thing!

245
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:31,151
Someone used to spend his every morning
in the bed with a hangover.

246
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,315
Mother is definitely
watching over us with a smile.

247
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't be playing shy, dad.

248
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,788
Say, doesn't it taste better
without the reeking of sake?

249
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:47,106
You rogue!

250
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,692
What now? Hooligans chieftain
Akagawa again? What do you want?

251
00:15:55,692 --> 00:16:00,000
This weird plaster cast you're wearing today -
turns out, it did quite a number on me.

252
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,843
I went to see a doctor the other day,

253
00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:05,872
elbow and shoulder are badly damaged,
might as well require a costly treatment later.

254
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:08,077
Hyuuma!

255
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:09,287
You incorrigible idiot!

256
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:13,957
Father! Please stop!

257
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,522
Beating me up won't fix anything!

258
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:17,210
What?!

259
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,676
If it came to this, I'll have you know,
I got a ton of grievances against you, too!

260
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,947
He says he has some grievances
against his daddy!

261
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:28,761
Highly amusing! Let's hear it!

262
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,201
Dad is a baseball junkie.

263
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:32,327
A baseball idiot!

264
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:34,421
A baseball-fixated loser
who never succeeded in it!

265
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:37,810
Hyuuma, no more! Father, too! Please!

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,564
I didn't want dad to feel bad for me,
so I was feigning a carefree face while eating.

267
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,154
But look!

268
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:47,865
Actually, every second
of holding the bowl like that,

269
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:51,000
is a struggle against that devil's
plaster cast that pulls my hand back.

270
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,911
Can you see all this cold sweat?

271
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:55,513
Crap!

272
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,765
I'm fed up! Screw it!

273
00:16:57,765 --> 00:17:00,826
I've had enough of sacrificing myself
to dad's pipe dream!

274
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:04,270
I see. Are you saying you won't follow me
on this path any longer?

275
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:07,265
Did I not make myself clear enough?

276
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:11,493
Enough, out of here!
He who doesn't obey his parent, should leave!

277
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,507
Would leave gladly!

278
00:17:14,612 --> 00:17:15,780
Hyuuma!

279
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:17,552
Let him!

280
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:34,000
Hanagata's plan going swimmingly.

281
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,914
I'm the best scout the Black Shadows
could ever have!

282
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:38,340
Stop!

283
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:42,197

Oh god... Save me, someone!

285

If you hit me with a hand
that's been forged by that plaster cast,

286
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:49,032
you'll make a hole in my head!

a warm welcome for you.

296

Feel like joining us yet?

Didn't they ask you to watch out, Yose?

308
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:34,437
I'm trying my best, but our pitcher's ball is just too feeble.

309
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:36,105
Not the pitch I'm used to.

310
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:38,669

You're still wearing a plaster cast.

315
00:19:54,037 --> 00:19:57,832
Hey, why won't you unleash
your unabated formidable strength upon us?

316
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:04,691
Could it be that you are that afraid
of competing with us head to head?

What now, scaredy cat?
Afraid, after all?

319
00:20:25,563 --> 00:20:28,907
And so, the dread of open confrontation
has been too unbearable for Hoshi.
