If so, boarding alone would take a long time. \NAlright, let's carry them on 12 ships. {lit: With so few of them, transporting the troops will take time. Alright, let's load 12 ships. - not sure what he means; それだけじゃ輸送に時間がかかる よし 12隻積んでいこう}

Sir. All the ships are urging for a dissolution of formation. {no clue what's issen, no clue what he means by "rushing into; breaking into; storming​/plunging into (war, etc.); embarking on (a new venture)"; wisper conveniently had a stroke on this line and HA has it "they are urging you to come all at once." so issen is apparently "all at once" but it still doesn't make sense; what I hear is "they are urging for you to rush into all at once" so I think what he means is, in fog they assumed a line formation - one after another, but without fog they're proposing to dissolve it and rush to the destination in the normal formation - "blob"}
