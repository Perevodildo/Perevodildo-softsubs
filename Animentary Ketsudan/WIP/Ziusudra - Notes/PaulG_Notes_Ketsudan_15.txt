Plus 30 planes in a new formation. \NContinuing the observation. {no clue what he means by "new formation (e.g. of aircraft) - 30 planes, continuing/following goal" - maybe he means "new model" or idk}

2. 0:02:20.59
So it'd be over a 100 planes... {no clue where did he get this from, as well as what the previous lines meant, 100機は越すな ; maybe that "formation" meant "pairs of planes" or something that'd bring the total to 110?}

3. 0:04:53.83
They've got cold feet! {no clue what he says, was "It's over optimistic." in HA; judging by next line, this gotta be something offensive}

4. 0:04:54.94
Wing commander! {no clue, -jou gotta be some military rank/commander but I can't make out which one; could as well be his name, but they don't normally just address people by name without a military rank or at least a honorifics; will be used again at 5:13 but still no clue - I'm at a complete loss, I suggest just shove in whatever obscure aviation rank, Paul}\NYou don't have to go that far. {lit: words too much - basically just "watch your mouth"}

5. 0:05:50.58
Scout to base. Scout to base. {no clue what's shiraeru here, kichi is clearly "base"; was "headquarters" in HA; shiru is "to know/let know" so maybe it's related}\NThis is Yame's plane of 305th Air Squadron.

6. 0:06:14.94
It's a task force with two aircraft carriers \Nsouth of Rendova Island. {I know for a fact this is a wrong and shoehorned translation but idk what's really anything before nanpou, the simplest explanation would've been that this rentouwatousei is one single landmark, but say it with me - there's no such landmark anywhere in the area; what I wrote would've been "rendobatou" and still doesn't account for sei part}

7. 0:08:20.80
To hell with it! {believing HA: I cannot stand it any longer.; no clue what he act. says}

8. 0:08:32.53
Commander, please let me do it! \NNo way Yame meets the makes alone! {no clue what's mourechiga but dekimasen clearly means "cannot do ..."; was "I will save Yabe alone." in HA but that's baloney, they know for sure he's dead so it's gotta be some verb about dying: I can't let Yame die alone}

9. 0:09:02.78
But that doesn't mean risking our lives recklessly. {no clue whats word in the middle, kinda like inochi (life), kinda like gunjin (war hero (who died in battle)​); was "but don't die in vain." in HA and it makes sense}

10. 0:11:43.01
Also observing ships following after. {no clue what he means: please note, mitomu(prolly "seeing") succeeding/following targets }

11. 0:12:22.50
We've no time to hesitate. \NIf we let them land unopposed now, we'll regret it later! {no clue waht he means: 上陸を図ってからでは悔いが残ります}

12. 0:13:14.21
In that sense, this decision \Ndid little to slow down the Americans. {unsure, maybe "was a little delayed by americans"}

13. 0:14:47.04
Now, let's pray that your luck in battle \Nnever runs out. And drink to it. {no clue what's bunkyokyuu, beliving HA: Now, pray for continued luck in the fortunes of war and make a toast.}

14. 0:15:11.07
At times, you can be intimidating too. {no clue what he really means: 時代というものは恐ろしい}

15. 0:15:47.09
At times like this, perhaps retreating to regroup \Nis preferable to just mindlessly attacking with all you've got. {/rebuild your formation}{not sure what he means, especially the soushiri wo ukete part: こんな時は総力を挙げて敵に対するより素知りを受けても後退し陣形を立て直すべきかもしれない}

16. 0:16:27.26
Ensign Koga, what were you thinking, \Nvolunteering for such an assignment? {believing HA, not sure what he means by douka shitoru}

17. 0:16:50.46
All pilots, enter the clouds dead ahead \Nand make a reverse sweep. {nc whats first word, could be koga tai (koga's formation)?; downhill rush; plunging down a precipice - probably means "make a dive"}

18. 0:19:18.09
Cretin! You're still injured. Back off! {nc whats last word, sounds kinda like "out of my way"}
