0:01:49.23  Having set the Pacific ablaze with a successful surprise attack on Hawaii, the Japanese army
0:02:06.33  The ultimate aim for Operation Java \Nwas the acquisition of its abundant oil resources.
0:02:25.72  Firstly, the coveted oil fields and air bases \Nof Sumatra and Palembang were captured
0:02:30.71  by the combined forces of three Japanese \Nforward paratrooper battalions.
0:02:44.53  About Southern Strategy operations,
0:02:50.03  The most pressing concern was the possible destruction of oil installations before the Japanese army takes over.
0:03:50.89  both the oil field and air base
            >> No need to repeat the "the"
0:03:54.48  Likewise, the Japanese army had previously conquered Sumatra, completing the isolation of Java. 
0:04:01.11  Lieutenant General Imamura set the foot down \Nwith his 40,000 men 16th Army.
0:04:59.34  A joint force of 80,000.
0:05:07.09  was facing the risk of an uprising of 50 million dissidents.
0:05:18.91  the National Independence Movement, \Nresisting the Dutch rule, was gaining traction.
0:05:27.45  Anticipating the Japanese army's approach, \Nthe Rear Admiral Doorman of the Dutch Navy
0:05:35.35  But it got wiped out effortlessly by the Japanese fleet \Nduring the Battle for Surabaya, off the coast of Batavia.
0:06:15.20  four Japanese transport vessels \Nwere hit by torpedoes.
0:06:20.38  Ironically enough, those friendly torpedoes passed right under \Nan already foundering American cruiser. 
0:06:31.39  Among the hit vessels, was Sakuramaru, carrying Lieutenant General Imamura, the 16th army commander.
0:07:03.45  >> casually switched ships
0:08:03.63  >> You could even say too much so.
0:08:08.61  Both sides are preserving themselves \Nright until the battle's conclusion. 
0:08:14.06  It is not as much a war for bloodbath, as one to ensure \Ntheir submission on minimal casualties.
0:08:24.98  Relax, we still have a long way off. 
0:08:41.99  Unaware of the Japanese army's calculation, the combined forces commander ter Poorten was worried sick.
0:08:48.13  We're reviewing combat reports\Nfor each of the districts.
0:08:51.29  The Japanese forces amount to 30,000 to 40,000.
0:08:57.62  As usual with coalitions, it always takes some strong minutes to relay information.
0:09:02.31  Exactitude! Exactitude is what we need!
0:10:05.43  They establish that \Nthe Japanese are 200,000 in total.
0:10:12.05  These estimates \Nwere grossly inflated by the natives
0:10:27.69  The Dutch efforts at gathering intelligence \Nwere not only curtailed by the natives,
0:10:32.34  but also fell victim to their lackadaisical spirit.
0:10:40.80  to create a golden opportunity for the Japanese to triumph.
0:11:04.53  Any new intel on Japanese activity? \NWe need to know.
0:11:07.78  What? \NYou want to know about the Japanese activity?
0:11:10.50  Good luck with that. \NThe newspaper has yet to hit our desk.
0:11:45.03  In the frontline, the enemy is not putting up \Nmuch of a fight. It's a bit anticlimactic, even.
0:12:55.25  In order to break the Dutchmen forces' morale, \NLieutenant General Imamura
0:13:22.99  The natives found the broadcast \Nabsolutely delightful.
0:13:26.05  The Japanese troops have properly secured the natives' support for their campaign.
0:14:30.30  the resistance of Dutch combined forces \Nincreased drastically.
0:15:26.34  >> to grind to a standstill
0:15:35.35  >> with more than 700 Japanese soldiers.
0:15:45.15  With those begrudging Indonesians, \Neven guerrilla warfare seems like a pipe dream.
0:15:51.60  If I was to order my Dutch troops to surrender,
0:15:54.17  the remaining coalized troops may disregard \Nany ceasefire order, doing as they please. 
0:16:04.71  As long as our fellow Dutchmen stand tall and fight,
0:16:07.95  fellow Britishmen and Australians \Nwon't back down.
0:16:13.76  Although Major General Sitwell, \NCommander-in-Chief of British-Australian forces,
0:16:18.05  channeled determination, \Nhe was out of touch with the brutal reality.
0:17:03.52  Major General Pesman, tasked with the defense \Nof Northern-Central district of Bandung,
0:17:14.39  Is it hard confirmed from Pesman, \Non the Northern-Central district of Bandung? 
0:17:21.87  Even so he had good resistance momentum...
0:17:36.43  I believe the enemy is ensnaring us.
0:17:38.76  Consequently, \Nwe may have to level the city.
0:17:41.74  Scorched earth policy is the way!
0:17:50.48  I feel you. \NThe casualties on our side are snowballing.
0:17:57.84  probably building upon \Na decisive defense.
0:18:00.60  However, this entails \Nmassive collateral damage to the locals.
0:18:14.21  Even if it exacts a big toll on us, \Nthe local populace must be protected.
0:18:19.93  By enabling this measure, \Nwe'll alienate them for the rest of the occupation.
0:18:24.47  We didn't come here to make the locals suffer.
0:18:30.50  Okay, let's rope the secret service agency in.
0:18:34.21  With an interpreter to escort him, a Japanese military officer disguised himself as a civilian.
0:18:39.22  As a part of a big ploy, he had already infiltrated Bandung and was awaiting for an opportunity.
0:18:49.27  Upon getting the order \Nfrom his military commander, he enacted the plan.
0:19:34.68  stifling Bandung as well.
0:19:36.50  I suggest that you surrender immediately. \NProlonging resistance any further is futile.
            >> Changing tense for this sentence gives it more impact and shortens it significantly.
0:21:07.65  On March 8th, the Dutch combined forces \Nfinally threw the towel.
0:21:28.91  The Bandung area \Noffers already too much of a sorry spectacle. 
0:21:33.05  It is needless to subject the locals \Nto more misery.
0:21:41.85  The surrender of Bandung is besides the point!
0:22:34.56  unexpectedly went swimmingly, \Nwith limited casualties.
0:23:42.67  Some say, the overarching decisions \Nof Lieutenant General Imamura,
0:23:46.13  Considering the natives' interests all along,
0:23:48.91  >> the comma after anihilation was forgotten.
0:23:48.91  minimized destructive battle tactics,\Nhighlighting his humanity.
0:24:09.47  The Southern Strategy operations \Naimed for the capture of the Celebes.
0:24:12.79  This time as well, the paratroopers were its vanguard.
0:24:15.55  Although a synergy \Nwith the ground troops was promoted,
0:24:18.72  the proud Skyborne Soldiers, \Nthe paratroopers
0:24:22.27  were mostly disdainful of land troops, giving gradually rise to animosity.
0:24:27.21  But at a later point, this would spark\Ninto a brazen decision, causing a major blunder.
