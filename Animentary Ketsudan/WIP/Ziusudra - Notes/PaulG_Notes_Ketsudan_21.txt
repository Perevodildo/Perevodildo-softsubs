Still, I can't get behind the goal of attacking \Nthe transport fleet, given in the previous explanation. {not sure what he means by https://jisho.org/word/%E5%BC%95%E3%81%A3%E6%8E%9B%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8B ; was "confused by" in HA}

And yet, we're being sent to attack the transport fleet? \NDo they really think that it's the best our 2nd Fleet can do? {not sure what he means: 我々第二艦隊を必要な人でも思っているのですか - "Do you even think that we, the Second Fleet, are necessary people?" - could be he means "do they think we're only fit for such unimportant job" or could be "do they think we're useless/unneeded"}

so persistent in the heads of his colleagues and superiors, spelled worrisome... No, spelled ill omen in big letters.

There won't be any decisive battle, \Njust us suffering enormous damage. {unsure what he means: 艦隊決戦なんてものじゃない必ず大きな損害を受ける}

They know they won't return alive! {could mean anything: 生還を来さずという / it means without coming back alive}

sent them a telegram, commending the struggle \Nof the decisive battle force... {not sure what to make of soutou, prolly strife; struggle; conflict; fight​}

I want our soldiers to regain their resolve \Nto overcome all hurdles we encounter. {nc what's this shishou isssedaru, was 将兵はここに、師匠一世ざるの覚悟を新たにし in whisper, nothing in HA}

10. 0:17:00.91
Unsurprisingly so. {no clue whatsoever, was "They are coming more and more."}

11. 0:17:21.04
And, after 5 more conventional bombs hits, \NMusashi no longer had any life in her. {nc whats seisan, not in HA; lit: seisan on the ship was exhausted/on the breaking point}

Warrant Wakamizu! {no clue what's issui, was soldier in HA, maybe name; *sui is usually something about water/naval}
